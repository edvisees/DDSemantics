# DDSemantics
Learning semantic regularities with data driven approaches

TODO List:
1. Set up baselines
1. Finish other attentions
1. Setup simplify models
1. Cheng & Erk use only the head lemma for arguments, shall we use more?
1. How to use only the relevant contextual scores?
1. Create an embedding for the empty slot (e.g. One empty slot vocab; 
Different vocab for different predicate; Different vocab for different slot)

Core Model Settings:
1. Pooling method
2. Attention method
3. Distance

Experiments setups:
1. basic
1. basic_arg_comp_3: using 3 layers for arg composition instead of 2
1. basic_event_comp_3: using 3 layers for event composition instead of 2
1. basic_gaussian_distance: use gaussian to simulate distances
1. basic_biaffine:
